# Simon Game Project 

The Simon Game is all about memory and pattern recognition. In this digital adaptation, the game generates a sequence of random colors and corresponding sounds. Your task is to replicate this sequence by clicking on the colors in the correct order. As you progress, the game will add more steps to the sequence, making it increasingly challenging. However, be cautious â€“ if you make a mistake, it's game over!

## Project Overview

The Simon Game is a simple yet engaging project I've created to teach myself the concepts of jQuery. It's a digital version of the classic Simon game, focusing on memory and pattern recognition. The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with jQuery and deepen my understanding of web development.

## Project Structure

The project's structure is kept simple:

- `index.html`: This file contains the basic HTML structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements.
- `index.js`: The main JavaScript file where I will write jQuery code to implement the game logic.
- `sounds/`: This folder contains audio files for the game's sounds.

## Learning Objectives

My primary objectives for this project are:

- **Learn jQuery**: Gain practical experience with jQuery by using it to build the game's interactive features.

- **Improve JavaScript Skills**: Strengthen my understanding of JavaScript by applying it to real-world scenarios.

- **Enhance Web Development Skills**: Explore how jQuery can simplify DOM manipulation and event handling.


## Conclusion

This Simon Game project serves as my practical playground for learning jQuery. I'm excited to dive into the world of interactive web development and explore the capabilities of this powerful library. As I progress through the project, I'll document my learnings and discoveries to solidify my understanding of jQuery and JavaScript. Happy coding!
